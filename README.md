# Snake Game

"""
This is a classic implementation of the old school snake game that many of us played on our phones when we were kids. 
The objective of the game is to control a snake and guide it to eat food, which causes the snake to grow longer. 
The game ends if the snake collides with the boundaries of the game screen or with its own body.

Enjoy playing the nostalgic snake game!
